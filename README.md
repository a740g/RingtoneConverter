# RingtoneConverter
A standard RTTTL ringtone to Sony Ericsson IMY ringtone converter program
that I wrote ages ago for my Sony Ericsson T610 cell phone. I wrote the program in Visual Basic 6.
Since it was lying on my hard drive for a long time and I have no plan to work on it, I am putting it in public domain.
Do with it as you please. Please note that I will not be responsible for anything.
I attempted to convert this to Visual Basic .Net. After 5 hours of tinkering, it is stil a mess. It can start but still needs a lot of work.
Someday...
